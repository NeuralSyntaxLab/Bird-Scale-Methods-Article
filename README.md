This repository contains all supplementary materials for the Bird Scale Methods project, including:

1. [Scale design files](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/Bird-Scale-Methods-Article/tree/30e998c190968e7b95ada76ec38cb6983e7311c3/Scale%20design).
2. [Scale system setup and assembly guides](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/Bird-Scale-Methods-Article/tree/30e998c190968e7b95ada76ec38cb6983e7311c3/User%20Guides).
3. Full parts list and where to purchase them (downloadable [here](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/Bird-Scale-Methods-Article/blob/30e998c190968e7b95ada76ec38cb6983e7311c3/Scale_system_parts_list.xlsx)).
4. [Arduino codes](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/Bird-Scale-Methods-Article/tree/30e998c190968e7b95ada76ec38cb6983e7311c3/arduino_code) neccessary for operating the system.
5. [Python scripts](https://github.com/NeuralSyntaxLab/Bird-Scale-Methods-Article/tree/30e998c190968e7b95ada76ec38cb6983e7311c3/Python%20code) necessary for operating the system.
6. 'PNG' versions of the figures shown in the article.
7. '.tex' file of the manuscript.


## Scale Design Files
This folder contains the full design of the scale device.
Here you can find '.pdf' files of the base, pin (3D printed Delrin perch) and weight, as well as the design summary page and a '3D-pfd' file for 360 view of the device. Also included is a '.skp' design file for use with CAD programs. Use this file to create the parts yourself.
